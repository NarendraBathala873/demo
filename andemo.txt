Here is a creative poem for you:

In the realm of code, where logic reigns,
Lines of text, like endless chains.
From dawn to dusk, we type away,
Creating worlds in which to play.

With every keystroke, dreams take flight,
In the silent hum of screens so bright.
Innovate, create, and never cease,
For in this world, we find our peace.
